"""
process_file.py — Part 2: one file of package descriptions, uploaded.

A Streamlit app that accepts an uploaded text file with one package description
per line, shows the total for every line, and writes the parsed packages to a
JSON file in the `data/` folder — `data/packaging1.txt` in, `data/packaging1.json`
out.

New here: an uploaded file arrives as **bytes**, not text, so it has to be
decoded before it can be split into lines. And a text file usually ends with a
newline, so the last "line" is empty and must be skipped rather than parsed.

Run it:  Run and Debug -> "Streamlit Run: Current File"   (see README Reference #1)
Test it: pytest tests/test_streamlit.py -k process_file
